1. Install WireGuard and Generating a Key

sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard

cd /etc/wireguard

wg genkey | sudo tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey

Note: privatekey will be the name of your file name for your private key. 
	Same with publickey. So you can name it with whatever name you would like

After that, you'll find privatekey and publickey file in your current directory
(/etc/wireguard/)

2. Configure IP Forwarding

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Uncomment the following line by removing # at the beginning of the line

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Once done, save the file (ctrl + x, and Y) and exit the editor

Apply the new option with command below

sudo sysctl -p

3. Configuring firewall rules

Install UFW

sudo apt install ufw

Add the following rules to allow SSH and WireGuard connections

sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp

Enable the firewall

sudo ufw enable

Check the active firewall rules

sudo ufw status

4. Generate Server configuration file

sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

Add the following to the file

[Interface]
PrivateKey = THE_PRIVATE_KEY_GENERATED_FROM_STEP1
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = YOU_DONT_HAVE_THIS_INFO_AT_THIS_POINT
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32 


5. Start WireGuard and enable it at boot

wg-quick up wg0

Once your WireGuard is running, you can check your configuration with the following command

wg show

To enable it to start automatically once it boots

systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
